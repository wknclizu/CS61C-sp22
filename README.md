# About

Hi, I'm a student self-learning CS61C(Spring 2022). This repository contains my work on CS61C labs and projects, if you find something mistake, please tell me or put it on Issues.

[Project 1](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/sp22/projects/proj1/) is to implement the Snake game using C.
[Project 2](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/sp22/projects/proj2/) is to write RISC-V assembly code to classify handwritten numbers using a simple machine learning algorithm. In particular, Calling convention, calling functions, using the heap, interacting with files, and writing some tests.  
[Project 3](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/sp22/projects/proj3/) is to use [Logism](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/tools/logisim-evolution-latest.jar) to build a CPU that runs actual RISC-V instructions.
[Project 4](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/sp22/projects/proj4/) is to write a simple version of numpy (a Python library for performing mathematical and logical operations on arrays and matrices, whose underlying code is written in C) and optimize code for performance mainly with SIMD Instructions and OpenMP.

bacause I can't see the google form in sp22's lab, [lab07](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/sp21/labs/lab07) is from sp21 and [lab10](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/sp21/labs/lab08/) is from sp21' lab08
